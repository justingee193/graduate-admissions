# Graduation Admissions Prediction 

This project uses student data from IEEE INternational Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science 2019 made public on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions), the project is focused on creating a Gradient Boosted Regressor while implementing hyperparameter optimization to predict the probability of gettting accepted to graduate school. This is done to gain insight into how the algorithm operates as well as working with hyperparameter tuning. Through this project, the model can be implemented an application for colleges to determine eligibility or for students looking to see their chances to getting accpeted to a particular graduate program.
